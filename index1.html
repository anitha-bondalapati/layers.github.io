            <p>The iPhone was the first mobile phone with multi-touch technology.Since the iPhone's launch, it gained larger screen sizes, video-recording, waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition, and app switching activated by gestures. Touch ID is still used for the budget iPhone SE series.
            The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android, and is a large part of the luxury market</p>
